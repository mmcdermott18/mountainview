        <h2>Office Policies</h2>
        <p>Take a moment to review our office policies. These guidelines are in place to ensure the highest quality of care and service for all our patients, fostering a smooth and efficient experience during your visit.</p>

          <h3>Insurance Coverage</h3>
          <p>Mountain View Internal Medicine and Pediatrics files insurance claims as a courtesy to our patients to most insurance carriers. It is important to note that we cannot guarantee coverage in any case. We do participate with many insurance companies (those who offer us participation), but there are also companies with which we are not participants, and within the companies with which we participate, there are specific policies that do not allow us to file claims.</p>
          <h5>Notes on Insurance</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>It is the responsibility of the patient to contact their insurance company to confirm that they will accept claims from our providers. We cannot tell you our status with any particular policy with authority—only your insurance carrier can give you this information.</li>
            <li>Any claims/amounts that are not paid in full by insurance for any reason become the responsibility of the patient. The patient will be billed and expected to pay in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Any questions about your bill can be directed to Michelle Evans at (540) 349-5124.</li>
            <li>You can pay your bill online by clicking on the “Pay my Bill” option at the top of this page.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Appointment Scheduling</h3>
          <p>Visits at Mountain View Internal Medicine and Pediatrics are by appointment only. We do not see patients on a walk-in, urgent care basis.</p>
          <p>If you have an acute need that we cannot accommodate, we recommend that you seek care at an Urgent Care Facility. If you have a worrisome symptom such as chest pain, intense sudden headache or dizziness, or an injury such as a fall, call 911 and seek care at an Emergency Department immediately.</p>
          <p>If you have non-emergency symptoms that concern you, you can call our office (even after hours), and we can advise as to the best plan of care—this may help you eliminate unnecessary visits to the Emergency Department.</p>
          <p>*Please note that if you have an acute need that we are able to schedule you for, you must be willing to see a provider other than your usual provider in our office. All providers and staff have full access to your medical chart and can assist you appropriately. Documentation of your visit will then be available for review by your usual provider, and your care will continue without interruption.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>No Show/late cancellation</h3>
          <p>Failure to show up for an appointment or cancelling an appointment with less than 12 hours’ notice may result in being charged for a “missed appointment”. Likewise, showing up more than 5 minutes past your scheduled appointment time may result in our not being able to see you, which amounts to a late cancellation as well. In this case, we will gladly reschedule your appointment to a future time. Your appointment time has been reserved for you, and the amount of time for that appointment reserved for your particular concern. Other patients have been scheduled directly following your appointment, and we are not able to delay their appointment because you were late for your appointment. In order to honor each patient’s appointment times, it is necessary to have the next patient here, checked in, and ready to be seen as soon as we can move into their appointment. While we cannot always control exactly how long a patient will take to receive the care they need, you CAN control the time you arrive for the appointment time you chose. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3>Prescriptions</h3>
          <p>We will not provide prescriptions for patients without having seen them for the issue for which they seek the medication. If you have seen another provider who has prescribed a medication for you, and we have not also seen you for that medical condition, you will need to seek refills of that medication from that other physician. This especially applies to controlled substances such as pain medications. Our providers are not under any legal obligation to provide prescriptions of any kind at any time.</p>
          <h5>To Refill a Prescription</h5>
          <p>You will need to contact the pharmacy directly and request that they send us an electronic refill request. This will be the quickest and most efficient way for you to receive your refill. Calls to our office and faxes from pharmacies only slow down the process, which is not in your best interest. Likewise, please note that the pharmacy will notify you when your prescription is ready to be picked up; your provider will be sending it electronically (or alternatively advising you) as soon as they are able to access their refill requests, and our staff has no way of knowing if the pharmacy has been able to complete the refill request we have sent.</p>
