        <h2>Televisits </h2>
        <p>As medical care and technology have evolved, we are now able to offer video televisits where you can stay in the comfort of your home, and still &ldquo;see&rdquo; your provider. This is covered by many/most insurance policies.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="tele-grid">
        <div class="text-space">
          <div class="text">
            <p>In order to participate in a televisit, you will need an active email account, and access to a smart phone or computer with an operational camera and mic/speaker so that we can see and hear you for the duration of your visit. (test your camera and microphone).</p>
            <p>When you schedule a televisit, we provide a link for you through email. A few minutes before your appointment time, you will open your email, click on that link, and be instantly connected to our office to proceed with your appointment. At your appointment time, your provider will join you on that link and the visit will begin.</p> 
            <p>Shortly before your televisit appointment, you will receive a telephone call from our nursing staff, who will get any information needed to prepare you for the visit, such as vital signs you have measured at home, your current medications, chief complaint, etc., and they will confirm that you are signed onto the email link and ready for your provider to join the visit.</p>
            <p>If you normally owe a copay for office visits, this will also apply to a televisit. The nursing staff who checks you in before the visit can get your credit card information to process that copay for you, and a receipt can be forwarded to you if you request it.</p>

            <h5>Important Information</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>VA law requires that you be physically in the Commonwealth of Virginia at the time of your televisit. You will be required to confirm this before the provider will sign on for your visit.</li>
              <li>Televisits will be billed to insurance and/or you will be billed just as if you came into the office. Any amount not covered by insurance will be your responsibility.</li>
              <li>Televisits are scheduled just as an in-person visit to our office. Patients are provided with the same staff and provider time as an office visit.</li> Televisits are not provided after hours.
              <li>Televisits are not an option for new patients, who must be seen in the office.</li>
              <li>Televisits are not an option for physicals or Well-Child checks. Medicare Annual Wellness visits CAN be provided by Televisit, as these are not actual physicals.</li>
